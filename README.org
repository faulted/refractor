* Information
This script was designed to be used in tandem with the Prism launcher on Linux. I was getting tired to mods not being
able to be dowloaded automatically when installing modpacks, so I automated a way to do it via a web scraper.

Based off of [[https://gitlab.com/C0rn3j/MCModUpdater][MCModUpdater]] by C0rn3j

* How to use
- Create a new CurseForge modpack Prism instance
- When the "Blocked mods found" popup appears copy and paste all of the text into ../modlist.txt in the refractor
  directory
- Run `python main.py` from the refractor directory to automate the download process
- Confirm that all mods have downloaded
  - The popup from earlier should confirm this for you in the bottom left corner
- Select "OK" in the popup
- Once the installation has finished and the instance has been created, return to the terminal and press any key to
  clean up the downloads directory
  - Downloads directory is ../Prism/mods by default
    - This can be changed in ../main.py for now

* Future Improvements
** TODO Make things more easily configurable
Things like specifying the downloads folder could be stored in a config.yaml file for example
